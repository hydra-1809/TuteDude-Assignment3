### Recursive Factorial in Python
This script demonstrates **recursion** by calculating the factorial of a user-provided integer. The logic uses a base case to terminate the function calls once the input reaches 1, ensuring the program returns the correct mathematical product of all descending integers.

### Python Math Module
This repository contains a concise Python script that utilizes the `math` library to perform scientific calculations. It processes user input to output the **Square Root**, **Natural Logarithm**, and **Sine** of a given number, demonstrating efficient use of Python's standard library for mathematical analysis.
